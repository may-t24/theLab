GAME PLAN:

The goal of our game is to escape the maze by collecting rings that will open the door at the end.

There is an easy level and a hard level. The easy level is a small maze that introduces the player to the game while
the hard level expands the maze and has more objects to collect.

The objects are rings represented as the character "O". The walls are made up of "|" and "-" characters. The locked 
doors within the maze is a "=" character. The exit door (to the next level) is a "#" character.

Our NPC will be placed at the start of the first level and will tell the player what to do: ("You must find all 
the rings to escape the maze!"). In the second level, the player must not disturb the NPC because he will
be upset with the player: ("Get away from me!")
